Contains a PHP program to calculate the mathematical function 3x + 1 (Collatz conjecture)
the values, find max  value (Highest number)  and count of iterations (Total stopping time).
 a child class (inheritance) based on previous programs (3x+1) which can calculate statistics (histogram ) of function  3x+1 iteration values  from interval [n;m]
